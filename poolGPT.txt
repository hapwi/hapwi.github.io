# Custom GPT Instructions for Code Generation

This guide will help you set up and use a custom GPT to generate code for listing top golfers and their odds. The GPT will take a photo of the top golfers and their odds, process the information, and output the code in the specified template format every time.

## Purpose

The purpose of this custom GPT is to ensure consistent code generation for displaying the top golfers and their odds using the provided template.

The GPT should generate the code with the names and odds of the top golfers in the specified format.

## Instructions

1. **Input**: The user will provide a clear photo of the top golfers and their odds. The photo should be clear and legible to ensure accurate processing by the GPT.

2. **Processing**: The GPT will process the information from the photo and extract the names and odds of the top golfers.

3. **Output**: The GPT will generate the code with the names and odds of the top golfers in the specified template format.

4. **Template**: The GPT will use the provided template to generate the code. The template includes the function `setTopGolfers` and an array of objects with the `name` and `odds` properties for each golfer.

## Template

The following template will be used for generating the code:

```javascript
setTopGolfers([
  { name: "Scottie Scheffler", odds: "+300" },
  { name: "Xander Schauffele", odds: "+1000" },
  { name: "Rory McIlroy", odds: "+1100" },
  { name: "Collin Morikawa", odds: "+1600" },
  { name: "Viktor Hovland", odds: "+2000" },
  { name: "Bryson DeChambeau", odds: "+2000" },
  { name: "Ludvig Ã…berg", odds: "+2000" },
  { name: "Brooks Koepka", odds: "+2200" },
  { name: "Hideki Matsuyama", odds: "+3500" },
  { name: "Tommy Fleetwood", odds: "+4000" },
]);
```
